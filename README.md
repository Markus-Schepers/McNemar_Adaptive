# McNemar Adaptive Two-Stage Design: Conditional Power Calculations

This repository contains R functions and reproducible examples for computing:

- Exact stage-wise power for McNemar’s test  
- Conditional power given first-stage discordant pairs  
- Minimal second-stage sample size required to achieve a target conditional power  
- Diagnostic and visualization tools for exploring the design

These functions accompany the methodological work described in **upcoming ISCB special issue 2026**.

## Features

- Exact conditional power calculation using the exact McNemar test  
- Robust boundary functions for stage-wise decision rules  
- Efficient search for minimal second-stage sample size (`nsecond`)  
- R Markdown file for generating heatmaps / visual summaries  
- Fully documented, transparent implementation to support reproducibility

## Installation

Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/mcnemar-adaptive-design.git
